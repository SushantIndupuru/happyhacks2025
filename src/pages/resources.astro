              Consider seeking professional help if you experience: persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness; changes in sleep, appetite, or energy; difficulty concentrating or making decisions; thoughts of harming yourself; withdrawal from friends and activities you used to enjoy; or if your emotions are interfering with your daily life. Remember, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness.

              Choose a calm moment when you have privacy and time. Be direct and specific about what you're experiencing. Use "I" statements like "I've been feeling..." or "I'm struggling with..." If you're nervous, consider writing down your thoughts first. If talking directly seems too difficult, try sharing an article about teen mental health as a conversation starter, or ask another trusted adult for help with the conversation.

              Not necessarily. Many mental health conditions can be treated effectively with therapy alone. Medication might be recommended for some conditions, but it's usually not the first line of treatment for teens. If medication is suggested, it would be part of a comprehensive treatment plan. A psychiatrist will discuss the pros and cons with you and your parents, and together you'll make a decision that feels right. Remember, you have a say in your treatment.

              Listen without judgment and let them know you care. Encourage them to talk to a trusted adult or mental health professional. Offer to help them find resources or even accompany them to an appointment if they're nervous. Check in regularly, but respect their boundaries. If they mention harming themselves, take it seriously and tell a trusted adult immediately, even if they asked you not to. Remember, you can be supportive, but you're not responsible for "fixing" their problems.

              Getting help for mental health is no different than getting help for physical health - it's a sign of strength and self-awareness. Many people seek mental health support; they just don't always talk about it. While stigma around mental health still exists, it's decreasing as more people openly discuss their experiences. Remember, your health and wellbeing are what matter most. Those who care about you will support you, and anyone who judges you for taking care of yourself isn't someone whose opinion you need to value.
