          title="Finding My Way Through Depression"
          quote="I started feeling depressed during my sophomore year. Everything felt gray and pointless. I didn't want to get out of bed, and I stopped hanging out with friends. When my grades started slipping, my mom noticed something was wrong. Therapy and medication helped, but what really made a difference was joining an art group. Creating something gave me purpose when I couldn't find it elsewhere."

          age={16}
          title="Battling Social Anxiety"
          quote="My social anxiety got so bad that I would get physically sick before school events. I'd overthink every interaction and replay conversations for days, cringing at what I said. Learning cognitive behavioral techniques helped me challenge those negative thoughts. It's still a work in progress, but now I can participate in class without my heart racing."

          title="Coping with Family Changes"
          quote="When my parents got divorced, I felt like my foundation was crumbling. I was angry and started acting out at school. A school counselor helped me see that I wasn't responsible for fixing my family, and that my feelings were valid. Joining a support group with other teens going through similar situations helped me feel understood."

          age={15}
          title="Overcoming Panic Attacks"
          quote="My first panic attack happened during a math test. I thought I was having a heart attack – my chest hurt, I couldn't breathe, and I felt like I was going to die. After it happened a few more times, I learned they were panic attacks. Working with a therapist, I learned to recognize the early signs and use grounding techniques to manage them."

          title="Finding Balance with ADHD"
          quote="I was always the 'hyper' kid who couldn't sit still. Getting diagnosed with ADHD in high school helped me understand why school was so challenging for me. With the right support, I've found strategies that work for my brain. I'm not 'lazy' or 'not trying hard enough' – my brain just works differently."
